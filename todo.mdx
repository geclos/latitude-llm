# TODOs

- Metrics in traces
- Associate traces to prompts in order to automatically trigger evaluations
  - Having to use the proxy to have automatic evaluations is a deal breaker
  - Pushing logs manually is also a deal breaker
  - Associating runs to prompts via the traces is less of a deal breaker but honestly not ideal either
- Improve SDK
  - It uses types from compiler
  - It does not export types from compiler
  - run/chat interaction is super weird (never gonna use it)
  - render returns types that are not compatible with openai (super weird)
