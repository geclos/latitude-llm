## Overview

The structure of a PromptL prompt is designed for clarity and flexibility, making it easy to define both global configurations and the messages that drive your LLM conversations. A PromptL prompt is divided into two main sections:

1. The **Config Section**, where you define global options for the prompt.
2. The **Messages**, which define the conversational flow between the user, assistant, and other roles.

## Config Section

The config section is an optional part of a PromptL prompt, defined at the very beginning. It allows you to specify global settings for your LLM, such as the `model`, `temperature`, or any other configuration supported by your provider.

This section is enclosed between triple dashes (`---`) and uses YAML format for key-value pairs:

```yaml
---
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.6
top_p: 0.9
---
```

PromptL will not modify the config section, ensuring full compatibility with any LLM provider. This flexibility allows you to include custom configurations tailored to your needs.

## Messages

The messages section defines the conversational flow of your prompt. Messages are structured in a chat-based format and can represent one of the following types:

- **System**: Sets the context or rules for the conversation.
- **User**: Represents messages from the user to the assistant.
- **Assistant**: Represents messages from the assistant to the user.
- **Tool**: Used for interactions with external tools or APIs.

```xml
You are a playful AI assistant that knows a lot about animals. Respond to the user's questions with fun facts about animals.

<user>
  What is the largest mammal in the world?
</user>
```

In the example above:

- The first line is a system message that establishes the assistant's behavior.
- The <user> block defines a user message.

## Bringing it together

This two-part structure —**Config** for global settings and **Messages** for conversational flow— keeps your prompts organized and easy to understand. Whether you're crafting simple interactions or complex, dynamic workflows, PromptL's structure makes it straightforward.
