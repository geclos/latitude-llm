---

PromptL provides a simple way to define variables in your prompts. Variables can be used to store and reuse values across your prompt, making it easier to manage and maintain your prompts.

Variables can be defined with logic expressions by wrapping it in double curly braces (`{{ }}`).

```
{{ name = "Alice" }}

<user>
  Hi! My name is {{ name }}.
</user>
```

In this example, we define a variable `name` with the value `"Alice"`. We then use the variable in a `user` message to greet the user. Variables will be interpolated in the prompt as plain text.

## Input Parameters

Variables can also be used without being defined in the prompt. In this case, the value for the variable can be provided as a dynamic input parameter when executing the prompt.

```
<user>
  Hi! My name is {{ name }}.
</user>
```

## Default Values

You can also define default values for variables. If a variable is not defined in the prompt or provided as an input parameter, the default value will be used.

```
Hi! My name is {{ name || "Alice" }}
```

## Expressions

Variables can be used in expressions to perform calculations or transformations in your prompt, which you can use to generate dynamic content.

```
{{ age = 30 }}
{{ ageInMonths = age * 12 }}

I am {{ age }} years old, which is {{ ageInMonths }} months.
```
