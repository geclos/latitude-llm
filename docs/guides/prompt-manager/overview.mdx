## Overview

The Latitude prompt editor allows you to define and structure your prompts with precision.

The editor allows to define prompts using [PromptL](/promptl/getting-started/introduction), a simple and intuitive language that enables you to create dynamic yet easy-to-understand prompts.

## Syntax

The language syntax is easy to understand and use, making it simple to create dynamic and engaging prompts. However, it also supports advanced features like parameters, snippets, and logic to create more complex and dynamic prompts.

To learn more about it, take a look at the [PromptL documentation](/promptl/getting-started/introduction):

- [Messages](/promptl/syntax/messages)
- [Configuration](/guides/prompt-manager/configuration)
- [Variables](/promptl/syntax/variables)
- [Conditional statements](/promptl/syntax/conditionals)
- [Loops and Iteration](/promptl/syntax/loops)
- [Snippets and references](/promptl/advanced/snippets)
