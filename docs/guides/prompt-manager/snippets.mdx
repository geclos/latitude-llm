## Overview
Snippets are reusable pieces of prompt content that you can reference in other prompts. They allow you to modularize your prompts, making them easier to manage and maintain.

## How to Use Snippets
To use a snippet in your prompt, you can use the `<prompt>` tag. Here's the basic syntax:
```
<prompt path="snippet_name" />
```
Replace "snippet_name" with the name of the prompt you want to include.

## Creating Snippets
To create a snippet you just need to create a prompt:
1. Create a new prompt in your project.
1. Write the content you want to reuse.
1. Save the prompt with a descriptive name.
1. You can now reference this prompt as a snippet in other prompts.

## Benefits of Using Snippets
1. Reusability: Write once, use many times.
1. Consistency: Ensure the same content is used across multiple prompts.
1. Maintainability: Update the snippet in one place to affect all prompts that use it.
1. Organization: Break down complex prompts into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how you might use snippets:

```text greeting prompt
Hello! Welcome to our customer service.
```

```text starter message prompt
<prompt path="greeting" />
How can I assist you today?
```

```text output
Hello! Welcome to our customer service.
How can I assist you today?
```

When you use this main prompt, the `<prompt>` tag will be replaced with the content of the "greeting" snippet.


## Nesting Snippets
You can nest snippets within other snippets.

## Considerations
- Be mindful of the total length of your prompt after all snippets are resolved, as there may be model-specific token limits.
- By using snippets effectively, you can create more maintainable, consistent, and flexible prompts in your Latitude projects.
- Use meaningful names for your snippets to make them easy to identify.
- Keep snippets focused on a single purpose or topic.
