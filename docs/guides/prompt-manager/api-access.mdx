## API Access
Latitude provides two types of API access: a general API for managing your workspace and project-level APIs for interacting with specific prompts.

## Run a Document
To run a Document through the API, you need to send a POST request to `https://gateway.latitude.so/api/v1/projects/<your-project-id>/commits/<your-commit-uuid>/documents/run`

## API key
The Latitude API allows you to run your Latitude documents from your app. To access the API, you will need an API key:
1. Go to the Settings page in your Latitude workspace.
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section.
3. Copy the auto generated API key or create a new one.

Use this key in the Authorization header when making requests to the Latitude API.

## Project and version
All prompts in your Latitude project are bounded to a project and a version, and can be identified by the document path.

You will find your `projectId` in the URL in Latitude, right after the `/projects/<projectId>`.

To always select the latest published version of any document within the project, you can use `live` as the version id. However, if you want to use a specific version or draft, you can copy its UUID from the Breadcrumb on top of the app.

## Run a document
Each prompt in your Latitude project can be ran via its own API endpoint. This allows you to integrate your prompts directly into your applications.

To run the document, simply send a POST request to this endpoint
`https://gateway.latitude.io/api/v1/projects/<projectId>/commits/<versionUuid>/documents/run`

The POST request must contain an `Authorization` header with your API key, and a body with both `documentPath` string and `parameters` object.

Example request:
```
POST /v1/projects/1/commits/live/documents/run
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "documentPath": "examples/hello_world",
  "parameters": {
    "user_input": "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```

The API will return a SSE streaming with the chain progress and all AI responses as different events.

Remember to keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code. Always make API calls from your server to protect your keys.
