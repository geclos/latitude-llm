## Key Concepts

### Version

A version represents a specific state of your project. It captures the content of all prompts at a particular point in time.

### Drafts

Drafts are work-in-progress versions that haven't been finalized yet. They allow you to make changes without affecting the main version of your project.

Other users can see all versions and modify them.

### Published version

Published versions are finalized versions that have been released into your app in production. They represent stable, approved states of your prompts.

## Working with Version Control

### Creating a Draft

To start making changes:

1. Navigate to a project.
1. Open the version dropdown in the sidebar.
1. Click on the New version button to create a draft.
    - Alternatively, you can click on View in an existing draft to open it.
1. Once you are in a draft, you can make changes to your prompts.

### Publishing a version

When you're ready to finalize your changes:

1. Make sure you are in the version you want to publish.
1. Click `Publish` in the sidebar.
1. Confirm the publish and then your changes will be in production.

## Best Practices

- Review changes carefully before publishing.
- Use drafts for experimental changes or work-in-progress features.

By leveraging Latitude's version control system, you can confidently manage your prompts, collaborate with team members, and maintain a clear history of your project's evolution.
