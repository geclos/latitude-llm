title: Logic in Prompts
description: Learn how to use conditional statements and loops in your prompts.
---

## Overview
Latitude allows you to add logic to your prompts, making them more dynamic and flexible. This guide covers two main logical constructs: conditional statements (if) and loops (each).

## Conditional Statements (if)
Conditional statements allow you to execute different parts of your prompt based on certain conditions.

### Basic Syntax

```
    {{#if condition}}
        // Content to be rendered if the condition is true
    {{/if}}
```

For more complex scenarios, you can use else and else if:

```
    {{#if condition1}}
        // Content if condition1 is true
    {{:else if condition2}}
        // Content if condition2 is true
    {{:else}}
        // Content if all conditions are false
    {{/if}}
```

### Using Variables in Conditions

You can use variables in your conditions. These variables can come from parameters or be set within the prompt:

```
    {{#if user_age >= 18}}
        You are eligible to vote.
    {{:else}}
        You are not old enough to vote yet.
    {{/if}}
```

### Using Step Responses

You can use the response from a step in your conditions. First, save the step response to a variable:

```
    <response as="variable_response">Is the user a premium member?</response>

    {{#if variable_response == 'Yes'}}
        Welcome, premium member! Here are your exclusive benefits:

    {{:else}}

    {{/if}}
```

## Loops (each)
The each statement allows you to iterate over arrays or objects in your prompts.

### Basic Syntax
```
    {{#each items as item}}
        // Content to be repeated for each item
    {{/each}}
```

### Example Usage
```
    {{#each ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] as fruit}}
        {{fruit}}
    {{/each}}
```

This will output:
- apple
- banana
- cherry

### Using the Index
You can also access the index of the current item in the loop:
```
    {{#each ['a', 'b', 'c'] as letter, index}}
        {{index + 1}}.{{letter}}
    {{/each}}
```
This will output:
- `1.a`
- `2.b`
- `3.c`

### Conditional Rendering within Loops
You can combine each with if for more complex logic:
```
    {{#each users as user}}
        {{#if user.isActive}}
            {{user.name}} is an active user.
        {{:else}}
            {{user.name}} is not currently active.
        {{/if}}
    {{/each}}
```

### Empty List Handling
You can provide an alternative output when the list is empty:
```
    {{#each items as item}}
        {{item}}
    {{:else}}
        No items found.
    {{/each}}
```
