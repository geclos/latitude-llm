## Overview

Latitude stores all the logs generated by your prompts in a database. You can use the logs page to monitor your prompts and evaluate their performance.

## How it works

Every time you run a prompt, from the API or from the UI, a new log is created.

To access the logs page, navigate to a prompt and click on the "Logs" tab. You'll see a table with all the logs generated by the prompt, some metadata like the timestamp, the prompt version used, latency, tokens used, and cost.

Clicking on a log will display a side panel with the full details of the log, including the list of messages.
