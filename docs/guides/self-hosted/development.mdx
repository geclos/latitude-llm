description: Learn how to set up a local Latitude instance for development
---

## Prerequisites:

- Install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Install [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) (`brew install tmuxinator` on Mac).
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install) and docker-compose (or a compatible alternative).

## Setting up the environment

Install dependencies:

```
pnpm i
```

Start the environment:

```bash
tmuxinator
```

Once docker compose is up (you'll see that on the 3rd tmux window) run the database migrations on a separate tab:

```bash
cd packages/core
pnpm db:migrate
```

## Signing up

Go to `localhost:3000`, sign up with any email, then open `localhost:8025`, click on the first email, and log in.

Welcome to your very own Latitude!
