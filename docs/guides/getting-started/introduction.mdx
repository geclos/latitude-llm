## What is Latitude?

Latitude is the open-source prompt engineering platform. With it, you can manage and deploy prompts as endpoints, evaluate their output at scale using automatically captured logs, and monitor their performance over time.

We built Latitude for team collaboration, so it can be used by developers, product managers, or domain experts.

It's designed to be easy to use, so you can get started quickly and iterate on your prompts without needing to worry about the infrastructure or tooling.

## Getting Started

We have a video overview of the platform, so make sure to watch it first:

If you're just getting started with prompt engineering, we recommend taking a look at our [Concepts](/guides/getting-started/concepts) glossary to get familiar with the terminology.

On the other hand, if you're already familiar with prompt engineering, you can jump straight into the [Quick Start](/guides/getting-started/quick-start) guide.
